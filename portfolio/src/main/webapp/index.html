      <h1>My Portfolio</h1>
      <p>Hello! My name is Eashan.</p>
      <p>I'm a CS major at the Georgia Institute of Technology and I have a 
          passion for social good. In an constantly technologizing society, 
          there is only so much we can do to help others. I aspire to use my 
          technical experience to make a difference on the world. Coming out of
          high school, I actively looked for ways to help out others. Now, it's
          my goal to do something impactful with my skills.</p>
      <p>Here is a link to my linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/eashanbhatt</p>
      <p>Before I get carried away with the rest of this page, I just wanted to
          highlight one of the organizations I'm in that has played a big role
          on my passion for cs.</p>
      <p>Bits of Good is a nonprofit organization that works with local
          nonprofits to create products that improve their efficiency and
          impact on the community. I have always loved getting involved with
          the community in any way I could and Bits of Good helps by combining
          that with technical abilities. One of the projects I worked on was
          involving the creation of an online tutoring hub that links college
          students with students of low-income stature that may not be able to
          afford tutors and get the best education they can because of financial
          struggles. I have since transitioned to working on the operations of
          the club so that I can get experience in a different area while still
          helping others. The community within Bits of Good has also helped me to
          want to learn more about different technologies and is my motivation for
          trying unique stylings that are shown on this page.</p>
      <p>This website presents a random collections of things that I like. Also,
          I'm practicing my web development skills and learning new things with CSS :)</p>
      <p>In my free time, I play a lot of video games, especially since I have been
          in quarantine. Some of the games I play/games I enjoy playing include:</p>
